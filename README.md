# My-Msg-Encryptor-and-Decryptor
The thing is cool. You type in a message, then it becomes encoded or encrypted so that you will have to have a key to open it, in this case to understand it.
Run the 'main.py' file
You will asked to chose a mode ( you will understand more after running the file)
after that write your message and press enter and then a number appears
there is also a new number in the 'encryption_key.txt file'

now its time you either send it to your friend with the numbers in the encryption key and then decode the message, like a pro
you run the main.py again chose the decoding mode or sth
first you type in the number that come in the console
then you type the encryption key file's number and you will get your message
